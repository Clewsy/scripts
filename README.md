# scripts

bu.sh - Uses scp to back up files and directories listed in a specified file to a remote server.

grab.sh - Uses rsync (to allow resume after interruption) to download a specified file from a remote server.

chuck.sh - Very similar to grab.sh, but used to upload to the remote server.

stuff.sh - Pulls and lists a bunch of useful (to me) info about the host (hardware, disks/mounts, OS, network).

vpn.sh - Kills current openvpn service then reconnects and confirms.  Useful for re-establishing connection if it goes bad.

where_am_i.sh - Pulls and displays info (IP, country, city, etc) from "ipinfo.io" - useful to verify vpn operation.

ytdl.sh - Written for use with termux (android) to download a youtube video direct to the device.
